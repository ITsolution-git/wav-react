          When talking to your friends about voting, you know best. But we can offer a few tips based on research studies about what works best. So here are the 5 things you want to keep in mind when talking to your friends about voting:
          <br /><br />

          <ol>
              <li>
                  <b>Be clear with your friends about how long stuff will take. </b>
                  A big psychological hurdle to first time voters is the mistaken assumption that registering or voting takes hours and involves lots of red tape.
                  Making it clear to your friends that they can hop on vote.org and register in 2 minutes (literally) helps to overcome this barrier.
                  Your friends can also skip lines on Election Day if they register to vote absentee (they receive their ballot by mail) -- though some states have restrictions on this.
                  <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                  <b>Know which issues your friends care about and talk about those in the context of voting. </b> Most young voters don’t associate voting with their everyday lives.
                  But linking voting with things that affect your friends all the time makes it more likely that they’ll view voting as salient to their lives.
                  If you know your friend works for minimum wage, talk about ballot measures that would increase the minimum wage!
                  If you know your friend is frustrated about her health care, make it clear that voting for officials with good healthcare policies would make a positive impact on her life.
                  <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                  <b>Don’t use the phrase “go vote” — instead, use the phrase “be a voter”. </b> Studies suggest that someone is more likely to register to vote if they absorb voting into their identity.
                  Make it clear that being “someone who votes” puts your friend into a group of other awesome people.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <b>Emphasize how many young people vote. </b> Even though we know the numbers about youth voter turnout -- and they’re not good! -- studies show that people are more likely to vote when they perceive it as the norm.
                  So don’t mention that only 1 in 5 young Americans voted in 2014. Instead say, “join tons of your classmates on Nov. 6” or “be one of the thousands of young people deciding who represents us in Congress.”
                  <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                  <b>Make a concrete plan. </b> Once your friend is registered, you’ll want to make sure they actually vote!
                  Research shows that the simple act of asking voters what their voting plan was — what time they intended to go to the polls, how they would get there, etc. — increases their turnout.
                  So ask your friends for specifics about their plans! It’ll be worth your while!
              </li>
          </ol>
