            <b>What does my friend need to register to vote?</b>

            <p>
                In most states, you must provide: 1) an address where you reside (this could be a permanent or temporary residence) and 2) an ID number (this could be either a current and valid driver’s license number or your social security number).
            </p><br/>

            <b>Is it too late to register?</b>

            <p>
                Every state has different registration deadlines.  Check out your states page on vote.org for your deadlines.
            </p><br/>

            <b>Do I need to re-register when if I’ve moved?</b>

            <p>
                Yes, you need to re-register each time you move.  You can register at your current address regardless of what address is on your license.  However, you could be blocked from voting if your state requires ID at the polling station (check if your state requires ID <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.headcount.org/voter-id">https://www.headcount.org/voter-id</a>) and you do not bring an acceptable document with your current address to the polls that meets the requirements in your state.  Most states accept a paycheck, utility bill or bank statement, but some have stricter requirements.
            </p><br/>

            <b>Does my driver’s license need to match my voter registration address?</b>

            <p>
                If you have re-registered and have an ID with an address that does not match, please check the ID and proof of residency requirements here: <a target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.headcount.org/voter-id">https://www.headcount.org/voter-id</a>
            </p><br/>

            <b>Can my friend vote at their student address?</b>

            <p>
                Yes, you are allowed to register to vote at your school address, but you should provide your campus mailing address as well as the physical address of your residence.  You may need to present some proof of residency at your polling place.  See this student voting guide for more information <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.brennancenter.org/how-vote-2016">http://www.brennancenter.org/how-vote-2016</a>                </p><br/>

            <b>My friend isn’t 18 yet. Can they still register?</b>

            <p>
                In all but a few states, you can register to vote if you will be 18 by election day.  For more information, please see this young voter guide <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/preregistration-for-young-voters.aspx">http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/preregistration-for-young-voters.aspx</a>
            </p><br/>

            <b>Do I need to pick a party when I register?</b>

            <p>
                No, you do not.  Some states, however, require you be enrolled with a party to vote in that party’s primary election.  To find out more, check your state election website or visit Headcount’s voter info hub <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.headcount.org/voter-info/">https://www.headcount.org/voter-info</a>
            </p><br/>

            <b>How can I check to see if my friend is registered already?</b>

            <p>
                When you sign someone up on BeTheWave, it will automatically check their voter registration status.  You can also check here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/">https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote</a>
            </p><br/>

            <b>Can a convicted felon vote?</b>

            <p>
                Laws vary by state.  In some, you must petition to have voting rights restored, and they are restored automatically once your sentence or parole ends. You should not register to vote if you are not aware of the status of your civil rights.  For more detailed information on state by state felon restrictions, please visit ProCon’s Felon Voter Information website <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://felonvoting.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000286">https://felonvoting.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000286</a>
            </p><br/>

            <b>How long does it take to process my voter registration?</b>

            <p>
                It can take several weeks; most states send out voter registration cards within seven weeks from receiving your registration.  You can verify your registration status here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/">https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote</a> and we recommend doing so at least a week before the registration deadline in case you need to fill out a new registration form.
            </p><br/>

            <b>My friend is studying abroad, can they register if they are a US citizen but are living abroad and don’t have a permanent address in the US?</b>

            <p>
                Yes!  In this situation, you must register at the last address you lived in before leaving the USA or the address where you will return to (there must be some indication you plan to live there like vehicle registration, property ownership, drivers license, family, etc.)

            <b>My friend is in the army and is currently deployed, can they register?</b>

            <p>
                These rules vary state by state, for the latest information, check out the Overseas Vote Foundation <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/home.htm">https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/home.htm</a>

            <b>My friend just moved here, can they register?</b>

            <p>
                Rules around residency vary by state.  In some, you are eligible immediately, others you need to wait a certain number of days.  No state can require you to live there for more than 30 days to be eligible to vote.

	        <b>Does my friend need ID to vote?</b>

	        <p>It depends on the state.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vote.org/voter-id-laws/">Find out your state’s rules here. </a></p><br/>

	        <b>What if my friend doesn’t have ID?</b>

	        <p>First, check if your friend needs a valid ID to vote in their state. Most states don’t require ID.</p><br/>
            <p>But if they do, don’t worry! Spread the Vote is an organization set up to make sure everyone who wants to vote
                has proper ID.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.spreadthevote.org/vote/">Fill out this short online form to request an ID.</a></p><br/>

	        <b>Can I use my phone at the polling place?</b>

	        <p>Depends on your polling place! If you want to use it to remember your voting choices,
                double check with whoever is working the polling station before you take it out (or else you could get in trouble).
                This is because it can be illegal to take photos in polling places!</p><br/>

	        <b>What happens if I'm in line when the polls close?</b>

	        <p> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-bill-rights/">Most states have laws on the books </a>requiring that every person in line when the polls close must be able to vote.

	        <b>Is Election Day a national holiday?</b>

	        <p>No, but it should be! That way people could take time out of their day to vote without being penalized for missing work!</p><br/>

	        <b>Can I get time off work to vote?</b>

	        <p>Depends on your employer!</p><br/>

	        <b>Can I get in trouble for sharing who I voted for at work?</b>

	        <p>Your company may have rules prohibiting political paraphernalia or using social media to express your political affiliations,
                so it's always a good idea to get acquainted with your employee handbook.
                And unless you signed some sort of contract that says otherwise,
                it's likely you're an at-will employee.
                This means that your boss can fire you whenever they want without having to establish just cause.
                Of course, labor laws exist in this country to protect people against adverse employment actions due to discrimination.
                So if your boss fires you, for example, simply because you're a woman, that's wrongful termination,
                and you could sue them for that. But very few laws exist that truly protect private-sector employees against getting fired for expressing their political affiliation.
		        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.workplacefairness.org/retaliation-political-activity"> A handful of states</a>, such as  <a target="_blank" href="http://law.onecle.com/new-york/labor/LAB0201-D_201-D.html"> New York</a> and  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/Publications_FEHADescr.htm">California</a>,
                have laws that offer protections for political affiliation, but even some of those are fairly limited.
                What's more, talking heatedly about politics at work could be construed as creating a hostile work environment, and people could file a harassment complaint against you for that.</p><br/>
