            <b>What does my friend need to register to vote?</b><br />
            In most states, you must provide:
            1) an address where you reside (this could be a permanent or temporary residence)
            2) an ID number (this could be either a current and valid driver’s license number or your social security number)
            <br /><br />
            <b>Is it too late to register?</b><br />
            Every state has different registration deadlines, ranging from 30 days out to Election Day itself.  Check out your states page on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/">vote.org</a> for your deadlines.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Where should my friend vote -- at their college address or their permanent address?</b><br />
            Either is fine! Some people prefer to vote in their home state or district and others prefer to vote where they are going to school. Bear in mind, however, if you want to vote in your home state, you will need to request an absentee ballot in advance and have it mailed to you.

            <br /><br />
            <b>Does my friend need to re-register when they’ve moved?</b><br />
            It depends. If you are away at college, you can choose whether to vote at your college address or at your permanent address (presumably your parents’ address).
            <br /><br />
            However, if you permanently move,  you do need to re-register. Why? Well because your address determines your polling location or where your absentee ballot is sent. It only takes 2 minutes to register!
            <br /><br />
            You can register at your current address regardless of what address is on your license.  However, you could be blocked from voting if your state requires ID at the polling station
            (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.headcount.org/voter-id">check if your state requires ID</a>) and you do not bring an acceptable document with your current address to the polls that meets the requirements in your state.  Most states accept a paycheck, utility bill or bank statement, but some have stricter requirements.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Does my friend’s driver’s license need to match their voter registration address?</b><br />
            If you have re-registered and have an ID with an address that does not match,
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.headcount.org/voter-id"> please check the ID and proof of residency requirements here.</a>
            <br /><br />
            <b>My friend isn’t 18 yet. Can they still register?</b><br />
            In all but a few states, you can register to vote if you will be 18 by election day. In some states, you can pre-register as early as your 16th birthday (but you can’t cast your first vote until 18 of course!).

            <br /><br />
            <b>Does my friend need to pick a party when they register?</b><br />
            No, you do not.  Some states, however, require you be enrolled with a party to vote in that party’s primary election.

            <b>How can I check to see if my friend is registered already?</b><br />
            When you sign someone up on BeTheWave, it will automatically check their voter registration status.

            <br /><br />
            <b>How long does it take to process voter registration?</b><br />
            It can take several weeks; most states send out voter registration cards within seven weeks from receiving your registration.
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/">You can verify your registration status here.</a> We recommend doing so at least a week before the registration deadline in case you need to fill out a new registration form.
            <br /><br />
            <b>My friend is studying abroad. Can they register if they are a US citizen but are living abroad and don’t have a permanent address in the US?</b><br />
            Yes!  In this situation, you must register at the last address you lived in before leaving the USA or the address where you will return to (there must be some indication you plan to live there like vehicle registration, property ownership, drivers license, family, etc.) Let your friend know it only takes 2 minutes to get registered!

            <b>My friend is in the Army and is currently deployed, can they register?</b><br />
            Yes, however rules vary by state.

            <br /><br />
            <b>My friend just moved here, can they register?</b><br />
            Rules around residency vary by state.  In some, you are eligible immediately, others you need to wait a certain number of days.  No state can require you to live there for more than 30 days to be eligible to vote.
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vote.org/">If your friend is ready to register, it only takes 2 minutes.</a>
