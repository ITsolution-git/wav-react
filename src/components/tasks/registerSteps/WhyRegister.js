                    Get in touch with { firstname } about registering to vote. You can call, email, text, show up at their door.... Whatever works for you!
                    <br /><br />
                    Let them know that it only takes 2 minutes to register on Vote.org (they can also check their registration status there too if they think theyâ€™re registered).<br />
                    Remind them the deadline to register in { state } is { stateInfo["inPersonRegistration"]}.
                    <br /><br />
                    It's also a good idea to send them a link to vote.org afterward.
                    <br /><br />
                    After you talk with them, report back for next steps.
